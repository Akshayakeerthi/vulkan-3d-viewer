# vulkan-3d-viewer

**vulkan-3d-viewer** is a Vulkan-based 3D engine built using Python, with Qt as the GUI framework and Qt Advanced Docking System (QtADS) for flexible docking support.

This project is developed for educational purposes to explore Vulkan rendering, engine architecture, and modern editor-style GUI design. It may contain experimental features, incomplete functionality, or minor issues.

---

## Features

- Vulkan-based real-time 3D rendering
- Python-based engine architecture
- Qt-based graphical user interface
- Advanced docking system using QtADS
- Editor-style interface inspired by Blender
- Docking workflow similar to Visual Studio
- Modular and educational code structure

---

## Requirements

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- Vulkan SDK
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
- tinyobjloader
- Qt (PySide or PyQt)
- Qt Advanced Docking System (QtADS)

---

## Purpose

This engine is intended as a learning project to understand:

- Vulkan rendering pipeline
- 3D engine fundamentals
- GUI integration with Qt
- Editor layout and docking systems
- Python integration with modern graphics APIs

---

## Disclaimer

This project is experimental and intended for educational use. Stability, performance, and completeness are not guaranteed.
